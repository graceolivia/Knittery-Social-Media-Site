# cs50_final_project
For my CS50 Web Track Final Project, I'm attempting to create a very simplified Ravelry clone. I'll use Flask and SQL, as we learned in our Finance app.

<h3>Plan</h3>

The Ravelry clone should allow users to register, login, logout, log projects and yarn in their stash, and view their profile. They should also be able to link projects to patterns and yarn to projects. Different users should have pages to show their profiles, which will also display their friends

<h5>Ravelry API</h5>

<a href="https://www.ravelry.com/api">Ravelry API</a> has a lot of cool information about the kinds of databases that the information is stored in. Obviously, I'm not able to take on anything this complex. 

<h5>To-Do<h5>:

- [x] Create Pages and Databases for Projects, Yarn, and Patterns
- [ ] Enable Login, Register, and Logout
- [ ] Create Profile Pages that show User info and their Projects
- [ ] Make Tag Databases to hold Friendships, link Projects and Patterns, and link Yarn and Projects
- [ ] Make search function to find users, projects, patterns, yarn
